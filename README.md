# feur-bot
 A discord bot that responds "feur" to any "quoi", and more...

To make the bot work you have to replace "YOUR TOKEN" by your discord bot token at the bottom of index.js
Also, make sure your bot has the permissions to read and write messages in the channels you want, and turn on 
"Message content intent" in "Privilege Gateway Intents" on your discord bot board
